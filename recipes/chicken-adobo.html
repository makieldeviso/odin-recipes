    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken thighs</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
            <li>White vinegar</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Black whole peppercorns</li>
            <li>Bay leaves</li>
            <li>Yellow onion, white onion, or red onion</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet or large dutch oven on medium heat, add oil. Followed by sliced onions and cook until translucent.</li>
            <li>Move the onions aside and place chicken thighs skin side down. Allow the skin to brown, about 3-5 minutes. Do not constantly move the chicken around or it won't brown well.</li>
            <li>Pour in soy sauce, garlic, black peppercorns, bay leaves and lastly white vinegar. For best results, do not stir the sauce as this prevents the acid from fully evaporating.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil. Then cover and reduce to a rolling simmer or low-medium heat for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Uncover the lid and flip the chicken over so the skin is facing up. Cover and simmer for another 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Uncover the lid and continue to simmer for 3-5 minutes so the sauce can thicken a bit. Remove off heat to serve & enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
