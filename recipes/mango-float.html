    <h2>Cleanse your palate with this special sweet goodness</h2>
    <p>This dessert is as a big hit during fiesta celebration. I always make graham mango float on special occasion. It’s an easy recipe and most of all you don’t even need to bake. Although I love baking but it’s nice to have a quick and easy recipe. Most of all, this is a refreshing dessert for the whole family.</p>
